# Spooky Travel Front-end

## Important

Ensure all your routes work as expected. The front-end cannot compensate for a broken back-end.

## Getting Started

- `git clone https://github.com/jmoncayo-pursuit/spooky-travel-frontend.git`
- `cd spooky-travel-frontend`
- `npm install`
- `touch .env`

Update `.env` with:

```bash
VITE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4001
